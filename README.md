#  Hello! 💬
My name's Michael and I'm a software engineer from Poland.

*I believe in coding as a tool of self-expression so my passion lies with creating.*
### Currently I am:
* Learning sockets in Python🔌
* Learning with GLSL shaders

### In the near future I will:
* Pick up learning Rust⚙
* Learn Three.js🔻
* Return to learning Unity (and make some games 🎉)
